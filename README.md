# Dynamical-Systems 
Part of my assignment for the course **AS5430 - Stability of Shear Flows** at **IIT MADRAS**. 
This repository contains Python based codes for solving some simple problems on dynamical systems. I have attached the assignment PDF and the codes are numbered according to the question numbers. I suggest to go through the reference attached for the basics in Dynamical systems and a detailed study on Stability of Shear Flows.
