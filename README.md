# Dynamical-Systems 
## Introduction
- Part of my assignment for the course **AS5430 - Stability of Shear Flows** at **IIT MADRAS**. 
This repository contains Python based codes for solving some simple problems on dynamical systems. I have attached the assignment PDF and the codes are numbered according to the question numbers. I suggest to go through the reference attached for the basics in Dynamical systems and a detailed study on Stability of Shear Flows.

## Method for solving a second order ODE using RK-4 integration
We have the equation
$ \frac{d\theta^2}{dt^2} + \mu\frac{d\theta}{dt} + \omega_0^2sin^2\theta = 0$
